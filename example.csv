The incorporated PCM allows shifting the energy demand for building cooling. A simulation case study is implemented to investigate the energy flexibility of an office building conditioned by the proposed system in a hot and humid climate. At first, the thermal storage properties of the macro-encapsulated PCM were determined by using the standard ASTM C1784-20. The obtained properties were then used in a whole-building simulation model validated using measurements in a real size walk-in chamber. Three different performance indicators were used to quantify energy flexibility: available storage capacity, storage efficiency, and power shifting capacity. Results show that with an average panel to ceiling ratio of around 66%, the radiant ceiling panel has an average sensible heat storage capacity of around 430 Wh/m2day and average annual storage efficiency of 86%. Results also show that the proposed system can shift the electric power demand for conditioning by 8 h compared to a conventional all-air system. These results confirm the benefit for implementing Demand-Side Management strategies that can exploit the energy demand flexibility of radiant ceiling panels incorporating PCM. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131840996&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2022.124447&partnerID=40&md5=9806898ed794d2207495204c0d54b9d4,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

This research proposes a novel modelling approach that utilises easily accessible national-level data to identify the required heat storage volume in buildings to decrease peak power demand and maximises carbon reductions associated with electrified heating technologies through smart demand-side response. The approach assesses the optimal shifting of heat pump operation to meet thermal heating demand according to different heat storage capacities in buildings, which are defined in relation to the time (in hours) in which the heating demand can be provided directly from the heat battery, without heat pump operation. Ten scenarios (S) are analysed: two baselines (S1–S2) and eight load shifting strategies (S3–S10) based on hourly and daily demand-side responses. Moreover, they are compared with a reference scenario (S0), with heating currently based on fossil fuels. The approach was demonstrated in two different regions, Spain and the United Kingdom. The optimal heat storage capacity was found on the order of 12 and 24 h of heating demand in both countries, reducing additional power capacity by 30–37% and 40–46%, respectively. However, the environmental benefits of heat storage alternatives were similar to the baseline scenario due to higher energy consumption and marginal power generation based on fossil fuels. It was also found that load shifting capability below 4 h presents limited benefits, reducing additional power capacity by 10% at the national scale. The results highlight the importance of integrated heat storage technologies with the electrification of heat in highly gas-dependent regions. They can mitigate the need for an additional fossil-based dispatchable generation to meet high peak demand. The modelling approach provides a high-level strategy with regional specificity that, due to common datasets, can be easily replicated globally. For reproducibility, the code base and datasets are found on GitHub. ? 2022 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138092225&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2022.125298&partnerID=40&md5=d85dc290b264652abcc057a538e69139,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

The economic viability of RECs though, depends on multiple interdependent factors that require careful examination for each individual context. This study aims at investigating the impact of electricity tariffs, ratio of electrification of heating and transportation sectors, prices of RE technologies and storage systems, and internal electricity exchange prices on the annual cost for electricity provision of a REC and its GHG emissions. A mixed-integer linear model is developed to minimize energy provision costs for a representative REC in Flanders, Belgium. The results indicate that RECs have the potential to reduce these costs by 10 to 26% and emissions by 5 to 13% compared to business-as-usual. The cost reduction depends on the type of electricity tariffs and the level of uptake of flexible assets such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. The shift towards a higher power component in the electricity tariff makes electricity storage systems more attractive, which leads to higher electricity self-consumption. The introduction of flexible assets adds the possibility to shift demand when tariffs are lower and makes higher installed capacities of photovoltaic systems economically viable due to the increase in the total electricity demand. However, RECs cost reduction compared to individual smart-homes amounts to only 4%–6% in the best cases. Uncertainties stemming from the costs of setting up a REC may reduce the estimated benefits. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133666759&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2022.119419&partnerID=40&md5=d183bbe936c758f2d9d62f6309683136,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

Smart homes/buildings are key sub-categories of smart grids. The advanced metering infrastructure connected to them continuously captures and stores the energy consumption data as datasets. Usually, understanding the structure of data and the behaviour of customers from energy consumption datasets is a tedious task. There are some literature works tried to explore various smart home energy consumption datasets as well as investigate customer behaviour, however, most of these methods are complex in implementation. Hence, this paper proposes a simple approach for the comprehensive exploration of the smart home energy consumption dataset. This approach can be used for any similar smart home dataset that contains numerical data. Further, using the exploration results, this paper analyzes the customers’ energy consumption behaviour by identifying peak hours in communication and electrical perspectives. To implement the proposed approach, an energy consumption dataset ‘Tracebase’ is considered as a case study. The exploration of the considered dataset results in 2356 files distributed among various directories. For customer behaviour analysis, the energy consumption data of all 43 appliances (with more than 95 million records) is considered from the “complete” directory of the “Tracebase” dataset. This analysis revealed the peak hours as hour-23 from the communication perspective and hour-9 from the electrical perspective. These represent the customer behaviour in terms of their participation in the power network, which further helps for better grid operations. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134660071&doi=10.1016%2fj.egyr.2022.07.043&partnerID=40&md5=4dc35abbb47989a16f45623c7eed0d61,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

The African continent has a good degree of solar irradiation. Therefore, it is imperative that the benefits of alternative energy generation through solar PV are maximized. In this paper, we present an optimization model of a case study in Sierra Leone which can be adapted for the Nigerian distribution system. This is because both countries are located in the same region (West Africa) and power systems are similar. We consider two demand response (DR) scenarios: price-based and incentive-based. The various DR schemes are compared to a situation in which there is no DR utilization to examine the impact of DR on peak load reduction and financial benefit to participants, and impact of renewable energy dispatch during peak and off-peak periods on financial benefits to participants. Simulation results show that the time- and incentive-based DR strategies reduce peak load demand by 11% and 14% respectively. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139998517&doi=10.1016%2fj.egyr.2022.09.127&partnerID=40&md5=ea11df5fd0a191fade28c6deb0c4471f,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

We find that the US commercial natural gas demand is price inelastic, with statistically significant (p-value ≤ 0.05) static own-price elasticity estimates of −0.137 to −0.245, short-run −0.152 to −0.261 and long-run −0.281 to −0.463. These estimates vary by choice of a sample period, choice of a parametric specification, treatment of cross-section dependence, assumption of partial adjustment, and exclusion of fixed effects. Further, they vary by season and region and their size has been slowly declining over time. Finally, commercial natural gas shortage cost declines with the size of own-price elasticity estimates. The policy implications of these findings are: (a) price-induced conservation's likely limited effect on the US commercial natural gas demand justifies continuation of energy efficiency standards and demand-side-management programs for deep decarbonization; and (b) demand response programs such as real time pricing and reliability differentiation efficiently allocate limited supply of natural gas during a shortage among heterogenous end-users, thus reducing an economy's aggregate natural gas shortage cost. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133209822&doi=10.1016%2fj.energy.2022.124610&partnerID=40&md5=2d57af2c9c5c8bfe35132992a8fc3bbf,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

These events leads to damage to distribution grid equipments, and they are cause widespread blackouts. This paper presents short-term resilience enhancement of the residential sections against hurricane at day-ahead. The lines outage in the electrical distribution grid is implemented as stochastic modeling by hurricane. The resilience enhancement is done in the multiple energy systems such as integrated gas, heat and electrical. The three-stage multi-objective functions optimization is proposed for resilience-oriented enhancement. The proposed strategy for resilience-oriented enhancement including installation of the mobile generators (MGs), implementation of the demand side management (DSM) strategy and local generation (LG) in each stage. In first stage optimization, minimizing the installation costs of the MGs is modeled subject to lines outage. The DSM strategy is modeled in second stage optimization as minimization of the electrical demand deviation than optimal demand level at day-ahead. Then, minimization of the 1) operation cost and 2) loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index are considered in third stage optimization. In addition to, installation of the MGs and DSM in first and second stages; LG by electrical storage systems (ESSs) in third stage optimization is taken into accounted. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is confirmed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution grid as three case studies by numerical simulation. The obtained results for operation cost and LPSP index in first case are $1,098,833.4 and 0.11 kW, respectively. In second case, LPSP index is minimized by %52.2 than first case. Finally, operation cost and LPSP in third case and with participation of the ESS are reduced by %52.2 and %0.78 in comparison to second case, respectively. © 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130411529&doi=10.1016%2fj.est.2022.104825&partnerID=40&md5=8c162bac08242cd8559e478946c1a2b7,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

This paper investigates the impacts of subsidy removal on future electricity demand and the required generation mix. A hybrid modelling framework is developed to analyse supply and demand sides under harmonised assumptions. An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model combined with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model forecast electricity demand under subsidy removal scenarios at different paces. A partial equilibrium energy systems model (MESSAGE) offers a cost-optimal configuration of power generation technologies to meet the forecasted demand during the period 2017–2050. The findings demonstrate that energy subsidy reforms can reduce total electricity demand by 16% and could ensure a 31% cut in cumulative CO2 emissions. The scenario analysis also shows that under an early and steady reform scenario and with gradual removal, the development of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency plans become cost-competitive. In contrast, the late and rapid subsidy removal path should tackle the lock-in effect's risk. This reveals that the early action in energy subsidy reform should be considered a priority over the removal speed. Finally, this paper discusses the potential policy implications beyond Iran. © 2022 The Authors",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135879336&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2022.113190&partnerID=40&md5=03786ddaa7c9fd9ae9f3bf713ddc29fb,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

Reliable load aggregation is critical for LSEs to improve profits in electricity markets. Due to the uncertainty, the actual aggregated response of loads obtained by conventional aggregation methods can experience significant deviations from the bidding value, making it difficult for LSEs to develop an optimal bidding and scheduling strategy. In this paper, a bi-level scheduling model is proposed to maximize the net revenue of the LSE from optimal DR bidding and energy storage systems ESS scheduling by considering the impacts of the uncertainty of demand response. An online learning method is adopted to improve aggregation reliability. Additionally, the net profit for LSEs can be raised by strategically switching ESS between two modes, namely, energy arbitrage and deviation mitigation. With Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimality condition-based decoupling and piecewise linearization applied, this bi-level optimization model can be reformulated and converted into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are verified in a modified IEEE RTS-24 bus system. © 2022 The Author(s)",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140872303&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2022.120167&partnerID=40&md5=05764d94366d1bba7bfdbc1439f8f126,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

To relieve the communication burden incurred by a large number of end customers who submit bids to purchase energy from the REP, the energy trading process is designed on a community basis. The end customers are grouped into multiple communities. With this approach, the proposed energy trading system coordinates the REP, the community energy management system in each community, and the local energy management system of each customer. The homomorphic encryption technology is integrated into the energy trading framework to enable the energy trading to be performed and settled without exposing individual customer's bidding energy purchase price and amount values.

In recent years, the proportion of energy consumption in cold storage has increased rapidly. The combination of solar power generation technology and demand side management (DSM) technology is a promising technology that can save energy and adjust to electricity price structure. In this paper, a new solar cold storage system is proposed for this technology. The refrigeration cycle is driven by the electricity generated by the low-price electricity at night and the solar photovoltaic panel during the day. The cooling capacity is stored in the cold storage tank and supplied to the cold storage for cooling according to the demand. The main purpose of this study is to establish a universal Simulink model for the new solar cold storage system, and to find the best control strategy to minimize the electricity cost. After the comparative analysis of the experimental results and the simulation results, the temperature compensation coefficient in the final Simulink model is 1.09. By comparing the experimental results of five schemes, the scheme D is selected as the best control scheme.

In this context, this paper presents a novel distributed control strategy to coordinate space heating across numerous residential households with diversified thermal parameters. By employing an iterative algorithm under the game-theoretical framework, each household adjusts its own heating schedule through demand shift and thermal comfort compensation with the purpose of achieving individual cost savings, whereas the aggregate peak demand is effectively shaved on the system level. Additionally, an innovative thermal comfort model which considers both the temporal and spatial differences in customized thermal comfort requirement is proposed. Through a series of case studies, it is demonstrated that the proposed space heating coordination strategy can facilitate effective energy arbitrage for individual buildings, driving 13.96% reduction in system operational cost and 28.22% peak shaving. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed approach in thermal comfort maintenance is numerically analysed based on the proposed thermal comfort quantification model. ? 2022",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142909073&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2022.120353&partnerID=40&md5=4bc12880ec59ab9e183f26c62f2d1f8f,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

Nevertheless, EI-based SG implementation has several shortcomings, such as scalability, congestion, and pricing, making the entire system vulnerable and complex. Hence, this paper comprehensively reviews the EI concept for utility energy service and demand-side management (DSM) in SG, related issues, and future directions. In line with the matter, this review showcases an inclusive description of EI technology, highlighting architecture, theory, and applications. Besides, the various EI integrated utility services are discussed with regard to cloud-based utility service, one-stop online utility service, short message service-based utility service, future utility service, and affordable utility service. Moreover, the DSM in SG connected with EI environment is explored, covering the resilience of EI architecture, 5G based EI, and EI-based DSM for sustainable consumption. The numerous key issues, problems, and challenges are outlined to identify the existing research gaps. Finally, the review proposes some improvements for future opportunities and developments for EI in utility energy service and DSM in SG. All the critical discussion, analysis, and suggestions would be valuable for the power engineer and researchers to enhance EI-based SG for future sustainable operation and management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138020073&doi=10.1016%2fj.seta.2022.102648&partnerID=40&md5=fd2b618a555c592b3f0e3ebd3d256366,,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd

This article presents a sizing approach for a local photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine (WT) hybrid energy system considering the capacity of local demand side management. In the approach, instantaneous energy consumption is modeled by analyzing the power characteristics of various load types. Based on the model, local electricity load can be scheduled to minimize the electricity consumed from the utility grid. The system sizing is then formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, in which the down-level is dedicated to scheduling the energy consumption in a given energy generation profile, while the up-level is to seek for the optimal sizing of the hybrid energy system. Genetic and efficient global optimization algorithms are used respectively to solve the down-level and up-level optimization problems. A practical industrial case study is used to verify the sizing strategy. Different sizing configurations are realized and compared to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125673649&doi=10.1002%2fer.7828&partnerID=40&md5=a51cc45891fe6cda0df2874a33960004,,,,,,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd
